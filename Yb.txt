Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000 (id)
ii. Hours = 1562 (business_id)
iii. Category = 2643 (business_id)
iv. Attribute = 1115 (business_id)
v. Review = 10000
vi. Checkin = 493 (business_id)
vii. Photo = 10000
viii. Tip = 3979 (business_id), 537 (user_id)
ix. User = 10000 (id)
x. Friend = 11 (user_id)
xi. Elite_years = 2780 (user_id)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: no

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.

I choose Las Vegas and Shopping category.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

SELECT CASE WHEN stars > 4.0 THEN '4-5 stars'
            WHEN stars > 3.0 THEN '3-4 stars'
            WHEN stars > 2.0 THEN '2-3 stars'
            ELSE 'below 2' END AS 'STAR',           -- divide the businesses into 4 groups based on their ratings                       
       
       COUNT(DISTINCT b.id) AS count,               -- count the distinct number of businesses from the business inner join of the business and hours table
       COUNT(hours) AS open_days_total,             -- count the number of entries in the hours table (grouped by the stars category), which happens to be the total number of days open
       COUNT(hours) / COUNT(DISTINCT b.id)  AS open_days_avg    -- divide the total number days open by the number of distinct businesses in the hours table
  FROM business b
  INNER JOIN hours h
  ON b.id = h.business_id                   -- creating an inner join of the business and hours table such that only the business IDs that show up in both tables are counted
  WHERE city = 'Toronto'                    -- set the city to "Toronto"
 GROUP BY STAR  


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

SQL code:

SELECT business.city, 
       category.category,
       business.name,
       business.stars,
       business.review_count
	   ON business.id = hours.business_ID)
       from (business INNER JOIN category ON business.id = category.business_id)
WHERE CITY = 'Las Vegas' AND category.category ='Shopping'
ORDER BY business.stars        

Result:
+-----------+----------+--------------------------------+-------+--------------+
| city      | category | name                           | stars | review_count |
+-----------+----------+--------------------------------+-------+--------------+
| Las Vegas | Shopping | Walgreens                      |   2.5 |            6 |
| Las Vegas | Shopping | Wooly Wonders                  |   3.5 |           11 |
| Las Vegas | Shopping | Red Rock Canyon Visitor Center |   4.5 |           32 |
| Las Vegas | Shopping | Desert Medical Equipment       |   5.0 |            4 |
+-----------+----------+--------------------------------+-------+--------------+

There is different number of review between the two groups; 17 & 36.
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT business.city, 
       business.neighborhood,
       category.category,
       business.name,
       business.stars,
       business.review_count
       --hours.hours 
       --from ((business INNER JOIN category ON business.id = category.business_id) INNER JOIN HOURS ON business.id = hours.business_ID)
       from (business INNER JOIN category ON business.id = category.business_id)
WHERE CITY = 'Las Vegas' AND category.category ='Shopping'
ORDER BY business.stars
		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1: # of business. The number of open-business is bigger than closed one.
         
         
ii. Difference 2: # of review & average of stars. Both of them in the open-business are bigger.        
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT is_open, 
       count(distinct business.id) num_business, 
       count(distinct review.id) num_review,
       avg(review.stars)
FROM business
JOIN review ON business.id =  review.business_id
GROUP BY is_open

Result:
+---------+--------------+------------+-------------------+
| is_open | num_business | num_review | avg(review.stars) |
+---------+--------------+------------+-------------------+
|       0 |           61 |         71 |     3.64788732394 |
|       1 |          446 |        565 |      3.7610619469 |
+---------+--------------+------------+-------------------+

	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         
What is the most successful category of business?
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

Among the categories, I calcalate the average of stars and the proportion of opening on each category. To get statistical reasoning, I only consider the set of category with more than 10 of business. 

From the output, we can see that "Local Service", "Health & Medica", "Home Services", "Shopping", and "Beauty & Spas" are successful; they are getting better reviews and higher opening rate. However, "Bars", "Nightlife", and "Restaurants" have lower stars and close frequently.
                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

+------------------------+--------------+-----------+------------+
| category               | num_business | avg_stars | avg_isopen |
+------------------------+--------------+-----------+------------+
| Local Services         |           12 |      4.21 |       0.83 |
| Health & Medical       |           17 |      4.09 |       0.94 |
| Home Services          |           16 |       4.0 |       0.94 |
| Shopping               |           30 |      3.98 |       0.83 |
| Beauty & Spas          |           13 |      3.88 |       0.92 |
| American (Traditional) |           11 |      3.82 |       0.73 |
| Food                   |           23 |      3.78 |       0.87 |
| Bars                   |           17 |       3.5 |       0.65 |
| Nightlife              |           20 |      3.48 |        0.6 |
| Restaurants            |           71 |      3.46 |       0.75 |
+------------------------+--------------+-----------+------------+     
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:

SELECT category.category, 
       count(business.id) num_business, 
       round(avg(business.stars),2) avg_stars, 
       round(avg(business.is_open),2) avg_isopen
FROM (business INNER JOIN category ON business.id = category.business_id)
GROUP BY category.category
HAVING num_business > 10
ORDER BY avg_stars DESC, avg_isopen DESC
